# ðŸ”„ðŸš¦ Circular Queue Using Linked List in C++

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Circular Queue** using a **singly linked list** in **object oriented C++**.  
Circular queues are queues in which the last node points back to the first node, making it circular.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Enqueue elements at the rear
- Dequeue elements from the front
- Circular linking ensures no wasted space
- Dynamic memory allocation (linked list)
- Display the queue elements
- Handles **empty** and **single node** cases
