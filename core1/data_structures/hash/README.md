🔒 Simple Hash Set in OOP (C++)

A fixed-size hash set implementation using open addressing and linear probing for collision handling.
Designed to efficiently store unique integer keys with basic operations:

✨ Features:

    ✅ Insert integers

    ✅ Delete integers

    🔍 Check if a key exists (Contain)

    📊 Display current table contents

⚙️ Uses a simple modulo hash function and handles collisions by probing the next available slot.

Ideal for learning core hashing concepts or quick usage in small-scale projects!
