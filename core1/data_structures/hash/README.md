# ðŸ§© Hash Set Implementation in C++

A simple and efficient **Hash Set** implementation in **C++**, using **open addressing** and **linear probing** for collision resolution.  
This project demonstrates how hashing works behind the scenes, including **insertion**, **search**, and **deletion** operations.
