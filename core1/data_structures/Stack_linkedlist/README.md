🚀 Features:

    🔼 Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

    🔽 Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.

    👀 Peek: Access element by index from the top (1-based).

    ✅ Is Empty: Check if the stack is empty.

    💥 Is Full: Checks for stack overflow (heap allocation failure).

    📋 Display: Prints all stack elements from top to bottom.

⚙️ How it works:

    Uses linked nodes where each node stores data and pointer to the next.

    top pointer always points to the current top element.

    Push prepends new nodes; Pop removes the current top node.

💡 Usage:

    Suitable for dynamic stack sizes — no fixed size limit (limited by memory).

    Ideal for understanding linked list based stack operations.
