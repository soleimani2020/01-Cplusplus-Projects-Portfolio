# ðŸ§  Linked List Implementation in C++

A **complete and modular implementation** of a **Linked List** in C++, featuring both **linear** and **circular** lists.  
This project demonstrates essential linked list operations, recursion, sorting, searching, and pointer manipulation.

âœ… Handles **Circular Lists** and **Loop Detection**  
âœ… Includes **Recursive** methods for counting and summation  
âœ… Implements **Merge Sort** and **Bubble Sort**  
âœ… Detects loops using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm  
âœ… Includes **Improved Linear Search** (Move-to-Front optimization)
