🗃️ Stack Using Array in C++

A simple Stack data structure implemented using a dynamically allocated array.
⚙️ Features:

    🔼 Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

    🔽 Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.

    👀 Peek: Access the element at a given index.

    ✅ Is Empty: Check if the stack is empty.

    ❌ Is Full: Check if the stack is full.

    📋 Display: Print all elements from top to bottom.

💡 Details:

    Uses dynamic memory allocation to create the stack array on the heap.

    top keeps track of the current stack top position.

    Stack size is fixed at runtime by user input.

📌 Usage:

    Best for fixed-size stacks where the maximum size is known in advance.

    Demonstrates basic stack operations with clear feedback messages.
