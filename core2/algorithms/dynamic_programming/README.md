# ♛ 0/1 Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming (C++)

A clean and efficient implementation of the **0/1 Knapsack problem** in C++.  
This project demonstrates how to **maximize total value** under a **weight constraint** using **Dynamic Programming** in an **object-oriented** design.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Object-oriented C++ design (`Knapsack` class)  
- ✅ Implements **bottom-up dynamic programming** (tabulation method)  
- ✅ Calculates **maximum achievable value** within a weight limit  
- ✅ Displays the **DP table** for better understanding  
- ✅ Easy to extend or modify for other optimization problems
