# ♛ Depth-First Search (DFS) Graph Traversal (C++)

A simple and efficient implementation of **Depth-First Search (DFS)** in C++.  
This project demonstrates how to traverse a graph **recursively using a stack (LIFO)** approach.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Object-oriented C++ design (`Graph` class)  
- ✅ Supports **undirected graphs** with adjacency lists  
- ✅ Recursive DFS traversal  
- ✅ Prints each visited node during traversal  
- ✅ Handles invalid edges gracefully
