# ♛ Breadth-First Search (BFS) Graph Traversal (C++)

A simple and efficient implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in C++.  
This project demonstrates how to traverse a **graph level by level** starting from a given node, using an **object-oriented approach**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Object-oriented C++ design (`Graph` class)  
- ✅ Supports **directed graphs** with adjacency lists  
- ✅ Traverses the graph using a **queue** (FIFO)  
- ✅ Prints the traversal order starting from a chosen node  
- ✅ Handles invalid edges gracefully
