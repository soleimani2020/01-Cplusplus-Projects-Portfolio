# 🗺️ Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Greedy Algorithm (C++)

A simple and efficient implementation of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using the **Greedy Nearest-Neighbor Heuristic** in C++.  
This project demonstrates how to find an approximate solution for TSP in polynomial time using an object-oriented approach.
