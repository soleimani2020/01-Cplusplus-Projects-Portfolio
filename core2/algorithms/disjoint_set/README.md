# ♛ Disjoint Set (Union-Find) in C++

A simple implementation of the **Disjoint Set** (also called **Union-Find**) data structure in C++.  
This project demonstrates how to **manage groups of elements**, check **connectivity**, and **merge sets efficiently** using **object-oriented design**.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Object-oriented C++ design (`DisjointSet` class)  
- ✅ Supports **MakeSet**, **Find**, and **Union** operations  
- ✅ Optimized with **Path Compression** and **Union by Rank**  
- ✅ Can be used for **Kruskal's algorithm**, **cycle detection**, or **connected components**  
- ✅ Easy to extend for other **graph connectivity problems**
